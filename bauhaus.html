                    The Bauhaus School  was influential for the art world. It is what shaped the new art and the way we view it to this day.
                    However, during that period, females were not given that much attention.
                    In fact, they were considered not qualified for certain arts because
                    they were thought to see in two dimensions, whereas the men would think in three dimensions.
                    This differentiated men and women in the Bauhaus School.
                    So much, that women were allowed only in the weaving department.<br><br>

                    However, this image ought to be important.
                    It portraits not only women but men as well. In fact, future designers of the world.
                    It shows equality and also the controversy of those times.<br><br>

                    This photography project is based on recreating and showing the problems faced in this time and period.
                    I have studied at the Royal Academy of Arts The Hague. Its main building is a lookalike of the Bauhaus School.
                    More so, its techniques and views of the world and art are also rather controversial.
                    In the photography, I have chosen a few of my classmates at that school.
                    People whose views of the world match with each other as well as, have chosen different paths for their lives.

                    It is a memory and also a reminder of the past and future.
