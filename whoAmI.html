                    Experience. The experience of the viewer.<br>
                    Can you change the perception? How? Experience and perception. <br>
                    Human inside the space.<br>
                    What do you feel? Calm? Maybe a bit anxious? Or, nothing at all?<br>
                    Experience, perception and senses.<br>
                    Do you understand now? Has your perspective of the space changed?<br> <br> <br>

                    I am sharing with you my experience. But, do you perceive it as I do? No.
                    You create your own perspective of it. That is what I want to do.
                    Leave you wonder on the what ifs. Make them your own.
                    Without you, my work is unfinished. You are the one who completes it. <br> <br>
                    I am in constant exploration. There is so much to question and understand but I begin to understand myself.
                    I gain insights in my way of working and interests.
                    They can be broad. However, it all comes down to one element: experience.
